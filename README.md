# react-d3-container
A simplified react container to hold a d3 visual component/chart. 

The goal is to be able to take one of Mike Bostock's D3 examples (from here: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock, for instance) and be able to drop it into a react component with nothing more than adjusting the width &amp; height and the select("...") statement.
