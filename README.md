# react-d3-container
A simplified react container to hold d3 visual components/charts. 

The goal is to be able to take one of Mike Bostock's D3 examples (from here: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock, for instance) and drop it into a react component with nothing more than modifying the width &amp; height and the select("...") statement.
