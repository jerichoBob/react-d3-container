# react-d3-container
Based on my https://github.com/jerichoBob/react-base, this WIP repo contains what I hope will be a simplified react UI container to hold d3 visual components/charts. The goal is to be able to take one of Mike Bostock's D3 examples (from here: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock, for instance) and be able to drop it into a react component with nothing more than adjusting the width &amp; height and the select("...") statement.
